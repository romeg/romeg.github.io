      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Maks! I am a System Administrator for Cxense ASA. My day to day job keeps me busy keeping our servers fleet running. My days consist of being a sysadmin, OCE, hardware guy, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know who else tomorrow. But I love what I do :)
I believe that sharing what we build, how we build it, and the mistakes we made along the way saves time for the next hundreds people doing similar.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been installing such configuration and discover that not a lot documentation exist in Internet. So, I write this post as summary. I think that this is also can be usefull for guys who want install GitLab runner and Virtualbox on headless server using Puppet and automate this provision as much as possible. There are some caveats that requires manual work but it is also can be easily automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
